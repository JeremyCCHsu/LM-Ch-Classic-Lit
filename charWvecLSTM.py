Problem 1
You might have noticed that the definition of the LSTM cell involves 
4 matrix multiplications with the input, 
and 4 matrix multiplications with the output. 
Simplify the expression by using a single matrix multiply for each, 
and variables that are 4 times larger.


Problem 2
We want to train a LSTM over bigrams, that is pairs of consecutive 
characters like 'ab' instead of single characters like 'a'. 
Since the number of possible bigrams is large, feeding them directly to 
the LSTM using 1-hot encodings will lead to a very sparse representation 
that is very wasteful computationally.
  a- Introduce an embedding lookup on the inputs, 
     and feed the embeddings to the LSTM cell instead of the inputs 
     themselves.
  b- Write a bigram-based LSTM, modeled on the character LSTM above.
     http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2329
  c- Introduce Dropout. 
     For best practices on how to use Dropout in LSTMs, 
     refer to this article.
     http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215

Problem 3 (difficult!)
Write a sequence-to-sequence LSTM which mirrors all the words in a sentence. 
For example, if your input is:
    the quick brown fox

the model should attempt to output:
    eht kciuq nworb xof

Refer to the lecture on how to put together a sequence-to-sequence model, as well as this article for best practices.

'''
TensorFlow does have a limit of 2GB on the GraphDef protos, which stems from a limitation of the protocol buffers implementation. You can quickly reach that limit if you have large constant tensors in your graph. In particular, if you use the same numpy array multiple times, TensorFlow will add multiple constant tensors to your graph.

In your case, mnist.train.images returned by input_data.read_data_sets is a numpy floating point array with shape (55000, 784), so it is about 164 MB. You pass that numpy array to rbm_layer.cd1, and inside that function, every time you use visibles, a TensorFlow Const node gets created from the numpy array. You use visibiles in 3 locations, so every call to cd1 is increasing the graph size by approximately 492 MB, so you easily exceed the limit. The solution is to create a TensorFlow constant once and pass that constant to the cd1 function like so :

trX_constant = tf.constant(trX)
for i in range(10):
    print "RBM CD: ", i
    rbm_layer.cd1(trX_constant)

BTW, I am not sure what your intention is in the above loop. 
Note that the cd1 function simply adds the assign_add nodes to the graph, 
and does NOT actually perform the assigns. 
If you really want those assigns to happen while you train, 
you should consider chaining those assigns via control dependencies to your final train_op node.
